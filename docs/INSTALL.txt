Installation
============

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.cart.shipping`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        pycountry
        collective.cart.shipping

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.cart.shipping-overrides

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
